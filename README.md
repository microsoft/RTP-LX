# RTP-LX

_Dataset for the paper [RTP-LX: Can LLMs Evaluate Toxicity in Multilingual Scenarios?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14397), by De Wynter et al._

_NOTE: this is a work in progress. Expect this to be updated soon!_

**WARNING: This repository contains and discusses content that is offensive or upsetting. All materials are intended to support research that improves toxicity detection methods. Included examples of toxicity do not represent how the authors or sponsors feel about any identity groups. This corpus was made by a multi-national, multi-cultural team of various faiths, beliefs, and origins. Please note that toxicity is dynamic, evolves with societal perceptions, and these labels may change.**


## What is RTP-LX?
RTP LX is a multilingual set of 1k+ (per locale) toxic prompts and passages designed for toxicity evaluation. It is manually translated from a subset of the original RTP dataset, and annotated by native speakers. It also includes:
- Coverage in 27 languages (28 because we split ZH-Hans and ZH-Hant)
- Manually designed prompts that are considered "hard" to translate to English, and could be considered offensive in the language's geolocale.
- Translations may include dialect-specific indications (e.g., Levantine Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese)


## Languages covered
RTP-LX currently covers 27 languages:

- Arabic (Egyptian, Levantine, Saudi)
- BCMS
- Chinese (simplified, traditional)
- Czech
- Danish
- Dutch
- English
- Finnish
- French (France)
- German
- Hebrew
- Hindi
- Hungarian
- Indonesian
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Norwegian (Bokm√•l)
- Polish
- Portuguese (Brazilian, Portuguese)
- Russian (Russia, Ukraine)
- Spanish (Spain)
- Swahili
- Swedish
- Thai
- Turkish
- Ukrainian


## Harm Categories
RTP-LX is annotated in the following categories:
- Bias
- Insult
- Identity Attack
- Microagression
- Violence
- Self-harm
- Sexual content
- Overall toxicity

## Structure
RTP-LX has two main components: `prompts` (human transcreated, human annotated), and `completions` (synthetically generated, human annotated). `Prompts` are meant to measure the effectiveness of your guardrails in multilingual scenarios, as well as automated annotation capabilities. 
`Completions`, on the other hand, are much, much more toxic and are designed for ablation analysis of harm categories.

## Uncompressing

To avoid crawlers, we have zipped and password-protected the entries. Please use the name of the repo all in lowercase plus "-entries" and `-16/4/24` as the password. So if the repo is "ASDF-BLAH", you want `asdf-blah-entries-16/4/24`.

## Updates:
- (Apr '22): Paper released!
- (Mar '24): V1.0 released! Passages annotated. This is the first full release of RTP-LX. We do have updates coming, so stay tuned.
- (Jan '24): V0.3 released! Added SW/BCMS. Compressed to file. Passages to come soon.
- (Dec '23): V0.2 released! Added 19 more languages, and included PT (pt) prompts. Note that BCMS/Swahili are projected for a later date.
- (Sep '23): V0.1 released! Prompts for ES, FR, DE, IT, JA, PT (br), ZH (simplified), AR and CS.
